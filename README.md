# ⚽ Soccer Live — Home Assistant Integration

Real-time football data in Home Assistant via ESPN, with optional API-Football support for users who provide their own API key.

> Built on ideas from [Calcio Live](https://github.com/Bobsilvio/calcio-live) by @Bobsilvio

---

## 🚀 Quick start

New here? This gets you a live team card in a few minutes:

1. **Install the integration** via HACS (see [Installation](#-installation-via-hacs) below) and restart Home Assistant.
2. **Add the integration**: *Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Soccer Live*. For the data source, pick **ESPN** — it's free and needs no API key.
3. **Choose what to follow**: pick **Team** (the default).
4. **Find your team**: select the league, then the team (for example *Eredivisie → Feyenoord*).
5. **Install the [Soccer Live Card](https://github.com/rononline/soccerlive-card)** via HACS.
6. **Add a card** to your dashboard: *Add card → Soccer Live Card*, and select your team's entity.
7. **Pick the suggested sensor**: the Team, Countdown and Match Center cards use the **`next_*`** sensor (`soccer_live_next_{competition}_{team}`). See **Which sensor do I need?** below.

> Want predictions, odds and injuries? Choose **API-Football** as the data source in step 2 instead and paste your API key when prompted — everything else works the same.

## 🗃️ Sensor types

Sensors are created automatically depending on your selection:

| Sensor type | Name pattern | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `team_match` | `soccer_live_next_{competition}_{team}` | Next / current match for a team |
| `team_matches` | `soccer_live_all_{competition}_{team}` | All matches for a team (competition-specific) |
| `team_matches_mixed` | `soccer_live_all_mixed_{team}` | All matches for a team (all competitions) |
| `match_day` | `soccer_live_all_{competition}` | All matches in a competition |
| `standings` | `soccer_live_standings_{competition}` | League standings |
| `top_scorers` | `soccer_live_scorers_{competition}` | Top scorers for a competition (auto-created). Note: ESPN removed its public scorers endpoint, so this shows "Not available" on the ESPN provider — use the API-Football provider for scorer data |
| `bracket` | `soccer_live_bracket_{competition}` | Knockout bracket (auto-created for cup competitions) |
| `all_matches_today` | `soccer_live_all_today` | All matches worldwide today |
| `news` | `soccer_live_news_{competition}` | News feed for a competition |

> **Friendly names & devices.** Every entry is grouped as a device (e.g. *Soccer Live · Feyenoord*), and each entity has a short, readable name — **Next match**, **All matches**, **All competitions**, **Match calendar** — while the technical `entity_id` stays verbose and stable (so existing dashboards keep working).

---

## 🎯 Which sensor do I need?

A **Team** entry creates several sensors (plus a calendar). Which one you point a card at depends on the card:

| You want… | Use the sensor | Entity |
|---|---|---|
| A single team's **live / next match** — Team card, Countdown, Match Center | **`next_*`** (`team_match`) | `soccer_live_next_{competition}_{team}` |
| A team's **full schedule across all competitions** — Team Competitions, extended schedule/fixtures list | **`all_mixed_*`** (`team_matches_mixed`) | `soccer_live_all_mixed_{team}` |
| A team's matches **in one specific competition** | **`all_*`** (`team_matches`) | `soccer_live_all_{competition}_{team}` |
| A **whole competition** overview — Standings, Matches, Top scorers, Bracket | the competition sensors | `soccer_live_all_{competition}`, `soccer_live_standings_{competition}`, … |
| Fixtures in the **Home Assistant calendar** / time-based automations | the calendar | `calendar.soccer_live_{team}` |

> Rule of thumb: **Team / Countdown / Match Center → `next_*`**, **Team Competitions & extended schedules → `all_mixed_*`**, **competition-wide views → `all_*`**. The card's entity picker suggests the matching sensor.

## ⚙️ Integration options

Configure via **Settings → Devices & Services → Soccer Live → Configure**:

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `scan_interval` | `3` minutes | Normal polling interval when no match is live. |
| `live_scan_interval` | `60` seconds | Extra refresh interval while a match is live (`15` / `30` / `45` / `60` / `90` / `120` seconds). Use `15` or `30` seconds for faster goal/card updates only when your provider quota allows it. |
| `enable_summary_enrichment` | `true` | Fetch extra match details. ESPN uses the summary endpoint; API-Football uses fixture events, statistics and lineups. Disable to reduce API calls. |
| `enable_unified_enrichment` | `false` | Fill missing rich fields from matching fixtures in other Soccer Live entries while keeping this entry's schedule and scores authoritative. |
| `archive_sync_url` | empty | Optional HTTP(S) JSON source using `soccer_live.archive.v1` or supported legacy Dutch fields. It is merged into the local archive. |
| `archive_sync_interval` | `24` hours | Refresh interval for the optional external archive (`1`–`168` hours). |
| `include_friendlies` | `true` | Include friendlies when using API-Football fixture data. |
| `api_football_season` | `0` (auto) | API-Football season to query. For standings/top scorers, auto mode uses the previous season before August. |
| `change_api_football_key` | — | *(API-Football only)* Paste a new key here to replace an expired/revoked one; leave blank to keep the current key. The value is validated on save. |
| `max_matches` | `0` (unlimited) | Limit the number of matches stored per sensor (5 / 10 / 15 / 20 / 30). Useful to reduce state size on large sensors. |
| `notify_goals`, `notify_cards`, `notify_match_status` | `true` | Choose which direct push-notification categories are enabled. |
| `quiet_hours_start` / `quiet_hours_end` | empty | Optional local quiet window in `HH:MM` format, including windows across midnight. |
| `player_watchlist` | empty | Comma-separated exact player names to expose in the Club card and monitor through `soccer_live_watchlist_event`. |

> **API key expired or revoked?** When API-Football rejects the key, the sensors report `api_status: authentication_failed` and Home Assistant automatically prompts you to re-enter it (a repair/notification appears — no need to delete the integration). You can also change it any time via the option above.

> **Sync status.** Each sensor also publishes a `sync_status` attribute — `initializing`, `fetching`, `ready`, `rate_limited`, `authentication_failed` or `provider_unavailable` — so a card can show concrete text (e.g. "fetching matches for the first time") during the first update instead of an empty card that looks like a misconfiguration.

> **Native helpers.** Every entry also creates **Sync status** and **Setup status** sensors and
> native **Refresh now**, **Rebuild match archive** and **Play match replay**
> buttons, plus a **Match event** entity. Team entries add a **Next kick-off**
> sensor; API-Football entries add an **API requests remaining** sensor. These
> compact entities are convenient automation triggers without templating large
> match attributes or manually entering event-bus names.
> Five binary sensors are also created: **Match live**, **Match today**,
> **Match tomorrow**, **Lineup available** and **Data degraded**. They are derived locally from
> published fixtures and make common automations template-free.
> The entry's device also offers translated native triggers for goals, cancelled
> goals, lineups, kick-off, half-time, the second half, red cards, full-time,
> postponements and cancellations. Existing event-bus automations continue to
> work unchanged.

> **Card contract.** Sensors publish `integration_version`, `data_schema_version` and `recommended_card_types` (the `card_type` slugs that suit the sensor), so the card editor can recommend the right card for a selected entity and warn when the integration is outdated.

> **Insights and local history.** Match sensors publish a provider-neutral
> `data_completeness` and `match_readiness` object per match, plus
> `data_quality`, actionable `data_alerts`, `matchday`, `match_archive` and
> `match_archive_summary`.
> Finished matches are kept locally in Home Assistant (up to 500 per
> integration entry); no extra provider request is made. Large derived
> attributes are excluded from Recorder history.
> Each match also publishes `source_sections` with availability, provider and
> update time for schedule, preview, lineup, timeline, statistics and review.
> Each standings sensor additionally keeps up to 200 changed table snapshots in
> `standings_history`; `competition_race` contains points gaps, actual remaining
> fixtures when available, games in hand, projections, result scenarios and
> maximum attainable points. Both stay out of Recorder.
> Schema v8 additionally publishes a reasoned `capability_matrix`,
> `season_transition`, structured `match_summary`, optional
> `unified_enrichment` provenance and mathematical title/Europe/relegation
> milestones. A stale explicit season creates a Home Assistant Repair issue.
> Schema v9 adds `effective_poll_interval`, `polling_reason` and an optional
> `detail_service` contract. Polling accelerates near and during a match, checks
> briefly for post-match corrections, relaxes at half-time and applies a
> conservative floor when the API-Football daily quota is nearly exhausted.
> Schema v10 adds a phase-aware `request_priority_plan`, provider-neutral
> `preview_analysis`, `momentum_analysis` and `post_match_analysis`, plus a
> structured `installation_check` on the Setup status sensor. The main fixture
> and score request is never deferred; only optional enrichment is reduced when
> quota is constrained.

### Local archive and refresh services

The integration registers services under the `soccer_live` domain:

| Service | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `soccer_live.refresh` | Immediately request a refresh from one or all config entries. |
| `soccer_live.rebuild_match_archive` | Add currently available finished matches to the local archive. |
| `soccer_live.clear_match_archive` | Permanently clear the selected local archive. |
| `soccer_live.export_match_archive` | Return a versioned JSON-compatible archive backup as response data. |
| `soccer_live.import_match_archive` | Replace an archive from a previous JSON export. |
| `soccer_live.sync_match_archive` | Merge an external archive URL immediately; the URL may also be configured for scheduled synchronization. |
| `soccer_live.play_match_replay` | Replay the recorded lifecycle as safe simulated events, with a deterministic demo fallback. |
| `soccer_live.clear_match_replay` | Clear locally recorded replay snapshots. |
| `soccer_live.export_match_replay` | Return recorded replay snapshots as response data. |
| `soccer_live.get_match_details` | Return/fetch rich details for one published match ID without refreshing the complete schedule. |

Every service accepts an optional `config_entry_id`; without one it applies to
all Soccer Live entries. The Archive card supplies the correct ID
automatically for its rebuild and clear buttons.
Cards discover `get_match_details` through sensor attributes and call it only
when a user opens a fixture whose heavy timeline/statistics/lineup sections are
not already present.
The complete response from `export_match_archive` can be pasted into
`import_match_archive`; a one-entry backup also remains portable when Home
Assistant assigned the restored integration a different config-entry ID.
The public [`soccer_live.archive.v1`](docs/archive-contract-v1.md) contract also
accepts common Dutch `datum`/`thuis`/`uit`/`uitslag` fields from feyod or a
personal MySQL sensor.
Remote synchronization is optional and bounded to a 5 MB response. A failed
archive server never interrupts normal fixture updates; its status and last
error are exposed through the Setup status sensor.

### Replay lab and restart-safe events

Match sensors retain at most 180 compact, meaningful snapshots for the current
fixture. The replay service emits the normal `soccer_live_*` lifecycle events
with `simulated: true`, `replayed: true` and `provider: replay`, so automations
and notifications can be tested before a real match. Replay never writes fake
scores into the normal sensors. Replays include score corrections, allowing a
VAR-disallowed goal flow to be tested without waiting for a live match.

Real event fingerprints are kept in local storage for seven days. This prevents
a Home Assistant restart or overlapping next/all/mixed sensors from announcing
the same lineup, phase, goal or card again. Direct mobile-app notifications use
a stable match tag and group, allowing later score updates to replace the
existing notification instead of creating a stack.

Every match event follows the provider-neutral event contract and includes
`event_uid`, `event_contract_version`, `provider`, `source_entity_id`,
`detected_at`, `score_at_event` and `is_correction`. The same real-world goal
therefore receives the same `event_uid` when two providers use different
fixture IDs or player-name abbreviations. Use `event_uid` as an automation or
notification deduplication key.

> **Shared coordinator and restart recovery.** Entities retain their
> provider-specific polling intervals as a fallback, while an entry-wide coordinator
> publishes a real `fetching` transition, tracks the entry's entities, owns
> entry-scoped request deduplication, coalesces adaptive matchday refreshes into
> one cycle and fans the result out to registered entities. It stores a
> bounded last-known snapshot for up to seven days, so cards and calendars can
> recover immediately after a restart while the first provider request runs.
> Existing entity IDs and event semantics are unchanged.

## 🌐 Data providers

ESPN is the default provider and does not require an API key. API-Football can be selected during setup and requires your own API-Football key.

Current API-Football support:
- Team fixtures: `team_match`, `team_matches`, `team_matches_mixed`
- Competition fixtures: `match_day`
- `all_matches_today`
- `standings`
- `top_scorers`
- Knockout brackets derived from fixture rounds for supported cup competitions
- Optional match enrichment for `team_match`, `team_matches` and `team_matches_mixed` via fixture events, statistics, lineups and head-to-head history

API-Football news is not supported. Bracket sensors are derived from the
fixtures endpoint for known cup IDs; unsupported or regular competitions do not
get an invented bracket.

The integration caches API-Football calls to reduce quota use:
- Main fixture/standings/scorers responses are shared by URL for up to 60 seconds. While a match is live, this cache follows `live_scan_interval` when that value is lower than 60 seconds.
- Fixture events are cached for 30 seconds.
- Fixture statistics and lineups are cached for 5 minutes.
- Head-to-head history is cached for 24 hours per unique team pairing.
- Predictions are cached for 6 hours, standings for 6 hours, injuries for 3 hours, and odds for 1 hour.
- The `api_football_quota` diagnostic attribute is refreshed through API-Football `/status` every 30 minutes.

The config-entry **diagnostics** (Settings → Devices & services → the entry → Download diagnostics) include an `api_football` section for monitoring API usage: per-endpoint call counts and cache hits, the last successful update and last HTTP status per endpoint, the endpoint cache size, and a `rate_limited_at` marker (set on an HTTP 429). This helps explain when a section is temporarily missing.

For API-Football team sensors, search teams directly by name during setup. Labels include the API-Football ID, because these IDs are different from ESPN IDs.

## ⚙️ Recorder / database size

The large, high-churn attributes (`matches`, `previous_matches`, `upcoming_matches`, `next_match`, the `schedule_*` lists, `standings_groups`, `scorers`, `articles`, `rounds`, `head_to_head`, `league_info` and the `last_*_event` payloads) are **automatically excluded from the recorder history** — the integration marks them as unrecorded, so the Home Assistant database stays small out of the box. The sensor *state* (the score summary) and small scalar attributes are still recorded, so state history keeps working.

If you'd rather drop the sensors from history entirely, you can still add this to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
recorder:
  exclude:
    entity_globs:
      - sensor.soccer_live_*
```

---

## 🔢 Finding a Team ID

Usually **not needed**: the ID is filled in automatically when you select a competition and team. Only required for manual entry.

1. **Via ESPN website**: open the team page on `espn.com` — the ID is the number in the URL:  
   `espn.com/soccer/team/_/id/`**`9723`**`/portland-timbers` → Team ID = **9723**
2. **Via ESPN API**:  
   `https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/soccer/all/teams`

---

## 📲 Push Notifications

The integration can automatically send push notifications when goals, cards, or match events occur. Configure this in the integration options:

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Soccer Live**
2. Click **Options** (gear icon)
3. Set **Notify Service** to your desired notification service:
   - `notify.mobile_app_yourphone` — iOS/Android Home Assistant app
   - `notify.telegram` — Telegram (requires notify.telegram service)
   - `notify.pushbullet` — PushBullet (requires notify.pushbullet service)
4. Save

**Notifications sent for (individually configurable):**
- ⚽ Goal scored
- 🟨 Yellow card issued
- 🟥 Red card issued
- 🔄 Substitution made
- 🏁 Match finished

You can also configure a quiet-hours window. Notifications are suppressed
during that window, while events and sensor updates continue normally.

Example notification: `"⚽ GOAL! Kramer (34') — Feyenoord 1 - 0 Sparta Rotterdam"`

### Alternative: Automations with Events

If you prefer more control, use Home Assistant automations with the exposed events instead:

## 🗣️ Voice assistant (Assist)

The integration registers three conversation intents that answer from your sensors:

| Intent | Example | Answer |
|---|---|---|
| `SoccerLiveNextMatch` | "When do Feyenoord play?" | "Feyenoord play Ajax at home, Saturday 20:00." |
| `SoccerLiveScore` | "What's the score for Feyenoord?" | "Feyenoord are playing Ajax: 2–1, 67'." |
| `SoccerLiveStanding` | "Where are Feyenoord in the league?" | "Feyenoord are 2nd with 7 points." |

- **LLM-based Assist** (e.g. an OpenAI/Ollama conversation agent): nothing to set up — the intents are exposed as tools automatically.
- **Default (sentence-matching) Assist**: copy the example sentences from [`custom_sentences/`](custom_sentences/) to `<config>/custom_sentences/<lang>/` and restart. English and Dutch are provided; add your own phrasings in the same format.

Responses are localised (English/Dutch, English fallback).

`schedule_match_count`, `schedule_live_count`, `schedule_upcoming_count`, `schedule_recent_count`, `schedule_live_matches`, `schedule_upcoming_matches`, `schedule_recent_matches`

**Automation-friendly last event attributes**:
`last_event`, `last_event_type`, `last_event_timestamp`, `last_goal_event`, `last_card_event`, `last_match_started_event`, `last_match_finished_event`

**Health/debug attributes**:
`api_status`, `last_successful_update`, `last_error`, `request_count`, `last_request_time`, `sensor_type`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `provider`, `provider_capabilities`, `api_football_season`, `api_football_quota`

The entry-level **Runtime status** sensor also exposes
`live_provider_monitor`, containing `status` (`not_live`, `healthy` or
`degraded`), live clocks/scores, active data alerts and the configured live
poll interval.

**Provider capabilities**: the `provider_capabilities` attribute lists what the selected provider can supply, so cards and automations can adapt. ESPN: `fixtures`, `scores`, `standings`, `top_scorers`, `news`, `brackets`, `lineups`, `statistics`, `head_to_head`. API-Football also adds derived `brackets`, `top_assists`, `predictions`, `odds`, `injuries` and `xg` (but not `news`).

---

## 📅 Calendar

Each config entry also creates a **calendar entity** (`calendar.soccer_live_<team>`) with the team's/competition's fixtures as events (kick-off time, `Home - Away` title, venue as location, competition as description; finished matches include the score). It reuses the match data the sensors already fetch — no extra polling — so the fixtures show up in the Home Assistant calendar and can drive time-based automations (e.g. a **Calendar** trigger a set time before an event starts).

All match-event rows above additionally carry the common event-contract fields
`event_uid`, `provider`, `source_entity_id`, `detected_at`, `score_at_event` and
`is_correction`. When two entries track the same team through different providers,
fired match events also carry `confidence` (`single_source` / `corroborated`) and
`sources` (the providers that reported the event).

Example automation blueprints are available in [`blueprints/automation`](blueprints/automation):
goal, yellow card, red card, substitution, match started, full time (final score)
and a configurable kick-off reminder (choose how many minutes before kick-off).
Additional blueprints cover persistent data degradation and recovery, matchday/live/full-time actions, and expected-versus-official lineup differences.
The player-watchlist blueprint turns `soccer_live_watchlist_event` into grouped
mobile notifications for goals, cards, lineup roles, injuries and transfers.
The **Soccer Live – iOS Live Activity** blueprint starts and updates one
Companion App Live Activity from the same events, filters it to your selected
team, keeps the score/clock current and clears the final result after a
configurable delay. It requires Home Assistant Core 2026.7 or newer, iOS 17.2
or newer and a Companion App TestFlight build with Live Activities enabled.

Every entry also exposes these lifecycle changes through its native **Match
event** entity. This is the easiest option in Home Assistant's visual automation
editor; the event bus remains available for existing YAML automations.

## 🗂️ Sensor attribute data contract

These attributes are guaranteed to be present when available. Card developers can rely on this structure.

### Full match object (inside `matches`, `next_match`)

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `home_team` / `away_team` | string | Team names |
| `home_abbrev` / `away_abbrev` | string | Team abbreviations |
| `home_logo` / `away_logo` | string | Logo URLs |
| `home_color` / `away_color` | string | ESPN team colors when available |

| `links` | dict | ESPN links: `stats`, `commentary`, `video`, `summary` |
| `has_stats` | bool | Boxscore available |
| `has_commentary` | bool | Play-by-play available |
| `clock` | string | Match clock (live) |
| `league_info` | list | Competition metadata: `name`, `abbreviation`, `logo_href`, `startDate`, `endDate` |
| `home_statistics` / `away_statistics` | dict | Per-team stats; includes `expectedGoals` (xG) when the provider supplies it |
| `canonical_id` | string | Stable provider-neutral identity for this fixture and UTC match day |
| `canonical_pair_id` | string | Stable provider-neutral team/competition/season pairing, also across a reschedule |
| `provider_event_id` | string\|null | Original provider fixture ID retained for detail requests |
| `preview_analysis` | dict | Observed pre-match form, ranking, H2H, absence, prediction and featured-player factors; absent when no useful facts exist |
| `momentum_analysis` | dict | Five-minute attacking-event pressure buckets derived from supplied match events; absent with insufficient observations |
| `post_match_analysis` | dict | Chronological factual milestones, equalizer/decisive lead, player of the match and xG when supplied |

At sensor level, `data_alerts` contains only observable issues, such as a
provider error, conflicting sources, stale live data, an absent live
lineup/timeline or a postponed/rescheduled fixture. Optional data that a
provider does not support is deliberately not reported as an error.
The sensor-level `request_priority_plan` records the current quota level and
which optional sections are allowed or deferred. The Setup status sensor adds
`installation_check`, a structured checklist for configuration, authentication,
fixture availability, season selection and quota health. Both attributes are
excluded from Recorder history where appropriate.

#### API-Football pre-match enrichment (next upcoming match only)

These are attached to the nearest upcoming match, and **only when real data exists** (they populate close to competitive matches — generally not friendlies or far-out fixtures):

| `league_name` | string | Competition name |

### League name and logo resolution

ESPN uses different data shapes per endpoint. The parser resolves per-match
league identity in this order:

1. `competition.league` or event-level `league`
2. top-level `leagues[]` matched by league ID
3. the `l:` part from competition/event `uid`
4. `altGameNote` before the comma, e.g. `FIFA World Cup, Group F`
5. curated logo overrides for common international competitions

The integration intentionally does not guess arbitrary ESPN CDN logo URLs from
league IDs, because many IDs do not match the logo file number.

### Enriched team_match sensor
