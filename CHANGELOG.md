# Changelog

## v3.6.38 (2026-06-24)
- sensor: goal attribution now uses `[ABBREV]` tag from ESPN detail strings to match goals to the correct team; falls back to positional order when tag is absent
- sensor: `last_event`, `last_goal_event`, `last_card_event` and related attributes now survive the next update cycle — carried forward until a new event of the same type overwrites them
- sensor: push notifications now use `minute` (not `clock`) for goal/card events, and `league_name` (not `competition_name`) for match-finished events
- config_flow: `{"sports": []}` no longer raises `IndexError` in the teams step
- config_flow: empty competition list now returns an `async_abort` instead of showing a broken empty dropdown; translated in all 6 languages

## v3.6.37 (2026-06-24)
- sensor: simultaneous goals now correctly attributed — home claims only `goals_scored` strings from the timeline, leaving the rest for away; `_extract_goal_scorers_from_details` simplified to work on the pre-filtered list
- scoreboard: prefer `competition.status` over `event.status` for match state, clock and period so a live match with status only in `competitions[0]` is no longer treated as N/A
- scoreboard: date filter interprets user-supplied `start_date`/`end_date` in the HA timezone instead of UTC, preventing midnight-local matches from being included or excluded by the wrong UTC day
- standings: handle both `seasons` (array) and `season` (singular object) fixture shapes; read `league_name`/`abbreviation` from `leagues[0]` as fallback when not present at the top level

## v3.6.36 (2026-06-24)
- scoreboard: `home_record`, `home_top_scorer`, `home_record_summary`, `home_standing_summary` and their away equivalents now use `home_comp`/`away_comp` — the remaining `competitors[0]`/`[1]` references were missed in v3.6.35
- scoreboard: `is_within_recent_window` adds 2 h to the configured window so the threshold is measured from match end (kickoff + ~2 h) rather than kickoff; a match with a 6 h window that kicked off 7 h ago and ended 5 h ago is now correctly shown
- sensor: `_extract_goal_scorers_from_details` now accepts an `exclude` set so home-goal strings are excluded when extracting the away scorer — prevents the same player from being attributed to both teams when both score in one poll cycle

## v3.6.35 (2026-06-24)
- scoreboard: use `homeAway` field from ESPN to correctly assign home and away competitors — was always taking `competitors[0]` as home, swapping teams in roughly half of matches
- scoreboard: `is_within_recent_window()` now compares naive local datetimes — the stored date string is local time (formatted by `_parse_date`), but the previous code treated it as UTC, causing 1–2 h drift depending on timezone
- sensor: goal deduplication now uses a per-match `_dispatched_goal_details` set instead of `max()` — a real goal scored after a disallowed goal (score reverts and rises again) was silently dropped
- sensor: sensor state for a post-match now reads `"Last match: X 2 - 1 Y"` instead of `"Next match: X vs Y"` — the `else` branch was also covering the `post` state

## v3.6.34 (2026-06-24)
- sensor: `match_finished` events now only fire on a known `in→post` transition; historical finished matches on first poll are silently skipped to prevent notification spam on new installs or cleared storage
- sensor: score corrections no longer trigger duplicate goal events — track the highest score seen per match so a score that dips and recovers to a known value does not re-fire
- sensor: `upcoming_matches` now starts from the first `pre`/`in` match when `next_match` is a recently finished match (was always skipping index 0, hiding the first upcoming fixture)
- sensor: invalid JSON from ESPN now sets `_last_error` and breaks the retry loop instead of propagating an unhandled exception that left `api_status` stale

## v3.6.33 (2026-06-24)
- config_flow: validate `start_date`/`end_date` format (YYYY-MM-DD) and `start ≤ end` before saving options; error messages in all 6 languages
- sensor: guard `datetime.strptime` with try/except so a bad stored date disables the filter with a warning instead of crashing sensor init
- sensor: set `_last_error` on HTTP 4xx (except expected 404 for top_scorers) so `api_status` correctly shows `error` instead of `ok`
- scoreboard: use `.astimezone(UTC)` instead of `.replace(tzinfo=UTC)` for timezone-aware dates — `17:00+02:00` now correctly becomes `15:00 UTC` instead of `17:00 UTC`
- integration: remove accidental `package-lock.json` (Python project, not Node)

## v3.6.32 (2026-06-24)
- sensor: parse errors no longer mark the update as successful — `api_status` now correctly stays `error` when `_process_data` raises an exception (was: `_last_error` set in except block then immediately overwritten to `None`)
- scoreboard: end-date filter now uses `23:59:59` instead of `00:00:00` — matches on the last day were excluded when scheduled after midnight UTC
- translations: remove unused `strings.json` (HA reads from `en.json`; duplicate file caused confusion)

## v3.6.31 (2026-06-23)
- scoreboard: replace hardcoded Dutch `team_name` fallback `"Alle wedstrijden"` with `"All matches"` — this string is a visible sensor attribute in HA

## v3.6.30 (2026-06-23)
- config_flow: catch `asyncio.TimeoutError` alongside `aiohttp.ClientError` — timeouts during setup/team-search no longer cause an unhandled exception
- config_flow: switch log calls from f-strings to `%s` lazy formatting
- sensor: translate remaining Dutch/Italian hardcoded state strings to English (`"Volgende wedstrijd"`, `"Geen wedstrijden beschikbaar"`)
- sensor/scoreboard: translate remaining Italian/Dutch docstrings and inline comments to English
- hassfest workflow: pin `actions/checkout` to `v7.0.0` consistent with other workflows

## v3.6.29 (2026-06-23)
- Prune `_calendar_cache` and `_calendar_locks` class-level dicts each update cycle — entries older than 5 minutes are removed and orphaned locks are dropped, preventing unbounded memory growth

## v3.6.28 (2026-06-22)
- Add URL-building regression tests for calendar/no-calendar sensor types
- Throttle repeated calendar fetch warnings per competition and error reason for 5 minutes

## v3.6.27 (2026-06-22)
- Reduce unnecessary ESPN calendar calls by only fetching calendar dates for date-range scoreboard sensors
- Add per-competition calendar caching and locking to prevent startup bursts across related sensors
- Improve calendar fetch logging: timeouts and HTTP/client errors now include sensor name, URL and error type instead of an empty message

## v3.6.16 (2026-06-20)
- Add Home Assistant automation blueprints for goal, red card and match started notifications

## v3.6.15 (2026-06-20)
- Docs: document health attributes, automation last-event attributes, schedule summary attributes and new match color/count fields

## v3.6.14 (2026-06-20)
- Automation attributes: expose `last_event`, `last_event_type`, `last_event_timestamp` and typed last-event attributes for goals, cards, match started and match finished
- Health attributes: expose `last_successful_update`, `last_error` and `api_status`
- Schedule summary: expose deduplicated `schedule_*` counts and compact live/upcoming/recent match lists

## v3.6.13 (2026-06-20)
- Match sensors: expose top-level home/away colors and `team_colors` for card auto-skins
- Match sensors: expose next/live match abbreviations, event IDs, event counts, H2H counts and broadcast counts for richer cards and automations

## v3.6.12 (2026-06-19)
- `standings` sensor: remove fallback ESPN logo URL construction — ESPN uses numeric IDs not competition code strings, causing 404 errors; card now shows fallback emoji instead

## v3.6.11 (2026-06-19)
- `standings` sensor: when ESPN standings API returns no logo, construct fallback URL from competition code (`espncdn.com/leaguelogos/soccer/500/{code}.png`)
- `standings` sensor: state changed from Dutch "Stand" to "Standings"
- `standings` parser: broader logo extraction (tries top-level `logos`, then `leagues[0].logos`)

## v3.6.10 (2026-06-19)
- `standings` parser: include `league_logo` from ESPN logos array
- `bracket` sensor: include `league_logo` and `league_name` from `process_league_data`
- `match_day` sensor: include `league_logo`; state changed from Dutch "Speelronde" to "Match day"
- `commentary` sensor: include `league_logo`; state no longer says "Geen live wedstrijd" — now "No live match"
- `news` sensor: include `league_name` and empty `league_logo`; state no longer says "artikelen" — now "articles"

## v3.6.9 (2026-06-19)
- Fix Dutch sensor state strings: `"tegen"` → `"vs"`, `"wedstrijden beschikbaar"` → `"matches available"`, `"Geen wedstrijden beschikbaar"` → `"No matches available"`

## v3.6.8 (2026-06-19)
- `bracket.py`: remove dead `round_name_nl`/`name_nl` Dutch fields; simplify slug/canonical tuples to plain strings; translate Italian docstrings to English
- `sensor.py`: bracket sensor state now uses English — `"Round of 16 (16 teams)"` instead of `"Round of 16 (16 ploegen)"`; fallback `"Bracket unavailable"` instead of `"Bracket niet beschikbaar"`

## v3.6.7 (2026-06-19)
- README: `league_info` attribute added to data contract table
- Config-flow: `commentary` setup step added to all 6 translation files (was missing — showed blank UI)
- Comments in `bracket.py`, `standings.py`, `sensor.py` translated to English

## v3.6.6 (2026-06-18)
- Add `icon.png` inside component directory so the HA update entity shows the integration icon

## v3.6.5 (2026-06-18)
- `league_info` objects now include a `name` field (ESPN full league name, e.g. "FIFA World Cup") — Countdown card uses this to display the competition name

## v3.6.4 (2026-06-18)
- Translate remaining NL/IT inline comments in sensor.py to English

## v3.6.3 (2026-06-18)
- All remaining Dutch/Italian log messages translated to English (goal/card/substitution/match events in sensor.py)
- URL-based shared fetch cache: sensors sharing the same ESPN endpoint now share one fetch per cache window instead of fetching separately
- Parser tests added (17 passing): scoreboard and standings parsers tested against minimal ESPN fixtures; direct module import bypasses HA's `__init__.py`

## v3.6.2 (2026-06-18)
- All log messages standardized to English (IT/NL strings in sensor.py and parsers)
- Data contract table added to README: match object attributes, enriched sensor fields, top-level `next_match_*` attributes

## v3.6.1 (2026-06-17)
- Pass `enable_summary_enrichment` and `max_matches` to all sensor constructors (were read from options but not forwarded)
- Translation labels for `enable_summary_enrichment`, `max_matches`, `notify_service` added in all 7 languages
- `next_match_has_stats`/`next_match_has_commentary` use parser flags with fallback to statistics/events presence
- Diagnostics: `sensor_type` now read reliably from state attributes (works for `team_matches_mixed`, `all_matches_today`, etc.)
- `sensor_type` added as explicit state attribute on every sensor

## v3.6.0 (2026-06-17)

### Bug fix (high priority)
- `_parse_match_datetime()` now tries both `%d-%m-%Y %H:%M` and `%d/%m/%Y %H:%M` — mismatch was causing `next_match_datetime_iso` and `next_match_minutes_until` to always return `N/A`/`None`

### New top-level attributes
- `next_match_broadcasts` — list of TV/streaming channels
- `next_match_attendance`, `next_match_neutral_site`, `next_match_has_stats`, `next_match_has_commentary`, `next_match_links`, `next_match_week`

### Diagnostics
- `diagnostics.py` added — download via HA Settings → Integrations → Soccer Live; includes competition code, sensor types, request count, match count, cache age (no large match payloads)

### Options flow
- `enable_summary_enrichment` (default: on) — disable to skip ESPN summary endpoint and reduce API calls
- `max_matches` (0/5/10/15/20/30, default: 0 = unlimited) — caps `matches` list to reduce recorder payload

## v3.5.6 (2026-06-17)
- Normalise indentation in `_fetch_match_summary` and `_get_calendar_data` HTTP session blocks

## v3.5.5 (2026-06-17)
- Fix indentation in HTTP session blocks in `sensor.py` and `config_flow.py` (normalised after aiohttp migration)

## v3.5.4 (2026-06-17)
- Use `async_get_clientsession(hass)` instead of bare `aiohttp.ClientSession()` in sensor + config_flow
- `_scorers_unavailable` now correctly set to `True` on 404 — sensor skips subsequent requests

## v3.5.3 (2026-06-17)
- Team matching on ESPN `team_id` (competitor ID) when available; falls back to name matching
- Parser: `process_match_data()` accepts `team_id` parameter

## v3.5.2 (2026-06-16)
- Fix: `scoreboard.py` skips matches with `< 2 competitors` (postponed/incomplete ESPN events no longer crash the entire sensor update)

## v3.5.1 (2026-06-16)
- Live polling: sensors with active matches refresh automatically every 60 s (in addition to base interval)
- Live polling only applies to live-capable sensor types; standings/scorers/news/bracket unaffected
- `manifest.json` version synced to `3.5.0` (was `3.4.2`)
- `hacs.json`: description added

## v3.5.0 (2026-06-15)

- Scoreboard: `week_number` from `events[].week.number`
- Summary: `last_five_home`/`last_five_away` from `boxscore.players[].statistics`
- News: `byline`, `last_modified`, `image_caption`, `image_credit`, `tags`, `premium`
- Top scorers 404: clear INFO log
- `manifest.json` version synced to 3.4.2
- News: `byline`, `last_modified`, `image_caption`, `image_credit`, `tags`, `premium`
- Top scorers 404: clear INFO log (not an error, ESPN doesn't support all competitions)

## v3.3.0 (2026-06-15)
- `async_step_campionato` → `async_step_league`, `step_id="campionato"` → `"league"` (all 7 translation files)
- `nome_squadra` / `nome_squadra_normalizzato` → `display_name_input` / `display_name_normalized`
- Italian error messages and comments in `parsers/scoreboard.py` → English

- All Italian inline comments replaced with English

## v3.0.9 (2026-06-15)
- `_process_data` returns `{"state": ..., "attributes": {...}, "events": [...]}` instead of mutating entity state in executor thread
- `self._state` and `self._attributes` now assigned on event loop only

## v3.0.8 (2026-06-15)
