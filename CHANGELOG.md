# Changelog

## v3.23.4 (2026-09-11)
- fix: load match details for archived fixtures. `get_match_details` now also searches `match_archive`, so a completed fixture that has aged out of the normal published lists can still be opened (#16)
- fix: on a mixed-competition sensor, ESPN match details are fetched with the fixture's own competition instead of the entry's configured one. Each ESPN fixture now carries its competition slug (e.g. `uefa.champions`), and the summary request uses it — so a Champions League match on a team configured from its domestic league loads lineups/timeline correctly; same-competition fixtures still fall back to the configured code (#16)
- tests: archived fixture is found by id; ESPN summary uses the fixture slug and falls back to the entry code

## v3.23.3 (2026-08-30)
- fix: don't notify a goal with a placeholder scorer. When a provider reports a goal but fills the scorer with a placeholder (ESPN sends "<TBD>") the goal is now held for the real name just like a missing scorer, instead of firing immediately with the token — so a slower provider that has the name can win. If no real name ever arrives the scorer is emitted as an empty string (not "<TBD>"/"N/A") so consumers can show their own "unknown" label

## v3.23.2 (2026-08-29)
- fix: bound the fetch retry loop so a single update can't overrun the poll interval during a provider outage. On repeated 5xx/timeout/connection errors the fetch now makes at most 2 attempts (was 3) and skips the wait after the final failed attempt, capping a failing update at ~22 s instead of ~36 s. This stops the "Updating soccer_live sensor took longer than the scheduled update interval 0:00:30" warnings and the stacked updates they caused when API-Football has a server-side outage; last-known data is retained and normal polling resumes automatically once the provider recovers

## v3.23.1 (2026-08-26)
- fix: only announce a lineup as available once it is the official team sheet, not a provider's early probable eleven. A predicted line-up filled in days before kick-off no longer fires `soccer_live_lineup_available` / `soccer_live_lineup_difference`; a line-up now counts only when the provider marks it confirmed, the match is live, or kick-off is imminent (within ~3 h)
- fix: `soccer_live_lineup_difference` no longer fires when the official line-up matches the expected one — it is emitted only when there is an actual difference (an unexpected starter or a missing expected starter), so no more empty "line-up differs" notification
- tests: cover the early-prediction rejection, the near-kick-off acceptance, and the confirmed-sheet transition

## v3.23.0 (2026-08-16)
- fix: goals no longer notify with an unknown scorer when the score ticks up a poll or two before the provider attaches the scorer name. Such a goal is now held briefly (a few polls) so it fires with the scorer; if the name never arrives it still fires after a short grace window
- fix: poll at the live rate around kick-off. A fixture whose scheduled kick-off has arrived but that the provider still reports as "pre" is now polled fast (previously polling dropped back to the normal interval right at kick-off, so match-started and the first live scores could be minutes late)
- tests: cover the scorer-defer (deferred-then-named, and grace fallback) and the around-kick-off polling window

## v3.22.4 (2026-08-10)
- fix: normalise ESPN substitution events to the provider-neutral direction. ESPN lists the participants as [in, out] without explicit fields, so cards showed the substitution direction reversed; events now carry `player` (out), `assist` (in) and `athletes` in `[out, in]` order, matching the other providers

## v3.22.3 (2026-08-10)
- fix: de-duplicate API-Football injuries/absentees. The provider repeats each absentee (once per fixture in the round), which listed every injured/suspended player twice; entries are now unique per player, reason and team

## v3.22.2 (2026-08-10)
- fix: API-Football prediction comparison metrics (form/attack/defense) that come back as an empty 0/0 pair are now dropped instead of surfacing as blank "0% / 0%" bars. A real comparison sums to ~100, so a 0/0 pair just means the provider had no data for it

## v3.22.1 (2026-08-08)
- fix: the adaptive entry-wide refresh cycle is now marked as a loop `@callback`. Without it, Home Assistant dispatched the `async_call_later` target to an executor thread, so `async_schedule_update_ha_state` reached `async_create_task` off the event loop — producing the "calls hass.async_create_task from a thread other than the event loop" warning. The refresh now runs on the event loop as intended
- tests: real-Home-Assistant assertion that the refresh target is a `@callback`

## v3.22.0 (2026-08-06)
- events: cross-provider reconciliation — when two entries track the same team through different providers (e.g. ESPN and API-Football), the same real-world event is no longer fired twice. The first provider fires the event tagged `confidence: single_source`; a second provider confirming the same event within a short window is suppressed and instead emits a `soccer_live_event_corroborated` signal (with the contributing `sources`), so automations can react to high-confidence events without duplicates. Reconciliation is fully defensive — any error falls back to firing the event, so it can never block the pipeline
- tests: pure `TeamReconciler` unit coverage plus a real-Home-Assistant test that the shared per-team registry corroborates a second provider

## v3.21.0 (2026-08-06)
- voice: added Assist / conversation intents — `SoccerLiveNextMatch`, `SoccerLiveScore` and `SoccerLiveStanding` — that answer from your sensors ("When do Feyenoord play?", "What's the score?", "Where are they in the league?"). Works out of the box with an LLM-based Assist agent; example English/Dutch sentences for the default agent ship under `custom_sentences/`. Responses are localised (EN/NL, English fallback)
- tests: pure response-builder coverage plus a real-Home-Assistant test that registers the intents and answers from live sensor state

## v3.20.3 (2026-08-05)

- release hygiene: fix the remaining ruff import-order issue in the ESPN header patch so CI can pass again
- tests: keep the shared ESPN header helper covered after the request-shape change

## v3.20.2 (2026-08-05)

- release hygiene: keep the ESPN user-agent workaround but fix import ordering so the CI release job passes again
- tests: keep the shared ESPN header helper covered after the request-shape change

## v3.20.1 (2026-08-05)

- ESPN requests: send a fixed user-agent alongside the existing English locale header so setup and fetches stay resilient if ESPN tightens client handling again
- tests: cover the shared ESPN header helper so the integration keeps using the same request shape across ESPN call sites

## v3.20.0 (2026-08-04)

- coordinator: coalesce adaptive matchday refreshes into one config-entry cycle and fan the result out to registered entities, while retaining normal Home Assistant polling as a fallback
- quota planner: keep schedule and score requests authoritative and defer optional lineup, statistics, timeline, preview, H2H and club calls in a phase-aware order when quota is constrained

## v3.17.0 (2026-08-02)

- thread safety: mark the delayed live-refresh callback as an event-loop callback so Home Assistant never executes entity scheduling in an executor thread
- polling: allow a 15-second live refresh interval for users whose provider quota permits faster goal and card updates
- native automations: add a Match tomorrow binary sensor alongside Match today and Match live
- lineup intelligence: emit `soccer_live_lineup_difference` when an official XI can be compared with an available expected XI
- blueprints: add data-quality recovery, matchday-mode and lineup-difference automations

- diagnostics: report restored snapshot counts alongside existing request and replay information
- tests: cover cross-provider fixture identity, reschedules, data alerts and coordinator snapshot bounds

## v3.12.1 (2026-07-29)

- reliability: measure process-local cache TTLs, provider backoffs and event throttles with a monotonic clock so DST and system-clock corrections cannot extend or shorten them

## v3.12.0 (2026-07-29)

- replay lab: record compact meaningful fixture snapshots and add play, clear and response-enabled export services with a deterministic demo fallback
- restart safety: persist event fingerprints for seven days so lineup, phase, goal and card notifications are not repeated after a Home Assistant restart

- dates: validate option dates as dates and make diagnostics robust for aware and legacy-naive cache timestamps
- release verification: retry GitHub asset lookups to tolerate short API consistency delays

## v3.10.0 (2026-07-28)

- Repairs: report rejected credentials and active API-Football rate limiting through Home Assistant Repairs
- contract: bump the published data schema to version 3 and recommend Matchday/Archive cards where applicable
- recorder: exclude all new high-churn insight, watchlist and archive attributes from state history
- tests: cover completeness, matchday selection, player matching and archive deduplication

## v3.9.9 (2026-07-27)
- events: deduplicate provider events across the next/all/mixed sensors of one config entry, including lineup and match-phase transitions
- notifications: localize direct goal, card, full-time, postponed and cancelled push messages in all seven supported languages
- logging: move routine per-sensor update messages from info to debug
- CI: add a focused Ruff undefined-name/syntax check and update GitHub Actions to Node 24-based versions
- repository: normalize accidental executable permissions on Python and JSON integration files
- tests: cover cross-sensor event fingerprints and localized direct notifications

## v3.9.8 (2026-07-27)
- bugfix: restore the missing `re` import in `sensor.py` so card-event dispatch no longer throws `name 're' is not defined` during live updates
- release: publish the runtime fix as a new integration version so Home Assistant users can actually receive it

## v3.9.7 (2026-07-26)
- Localization: convert config-flow choice fields to translated selectors so setup no longer shows raw English labels
- Compatibility: keep legacy config entries working while normalizing the stored follow-selection values
- UI: localize Match Center preview coverage labels and clean up the Club recent-match detail row
- Hygiene: stop forcing custom entity IDs on sensor and calendar entities so Home Assistant warnings go away

## v3.9.6 (2026-07-24)
- match events: the integration now actually fires `soccer_live_second_half`, `soccer_live_match_postponed` and `soccer_live_match_cancelled` on the corresponding phase transition (they were only reachable via the test simulator before, so automations tested against them never triggered live). The halftime detector was generalised into a single phase-transition dispatcher driven by `match_contract.PHASE_EVENTS`, keeping the first-observation guard so a restart can't replay old transitions
- notifications: postponed and cancelled matches now also send an optional push (when a notify service is configured), alongside the existing goal/card/full-time ones
- simulator: added `yellow_card` and `substitution` (both are real events but weren't simulatable), so the simulator now covers the full match-lifecycle event set
- tests: added a regression lock asserting every event the simulator can fire is one the integration actually emits, plus phase-transition mapping/dispatch coverage
- lineup events: never announce restored lineup data for completed historical fixtures
- restart safety: prevent summary enrichment after an HA restart from producing false "lineup available" notifications
- tests: cover historical post-match lineup enrichment while preserving real pre-match transitions

## v3.9.4 (2026-07-24)
- API-Football H2H: enrich the first three selectable live/upcoming fixtures on list sensors instead of only the nearest fixture
- Match Center: switching from an earlier match such as Atalanta to Sparta now retains fixture-specific H2H data
- quota: keep H2H bounded to three fixtures and reuse the existing canonical 24-hour matchup cache
- tests: reproduce and cover a schedule where the requested H2H fixture is not the first upcoming match

## v3.9.3 (2026-07-24)
- API-Football H2H: prioritize the single cached H2H request before historical fixture enrichment
- quota: prevent events/statistics/lineup calls for list sensors from triggering provider backoff before H2H is fetched
- tests: verify H2H is the first enrichment request for an upcoming fixture in a mixed team schedule

## v3.9.2 (2026-07-24)
- API-Football H2H: fetch up to eight completed meetings for the live or nearest upcoming fixture
- quota: canonicalize the team pair and cache H2H responses for 24 hours, sharing one request across sensors
- match contract: attach normalized, newest-first `head_to_head` data already supported by Team, Countdown, Matches and Match Center cards
- robustness: ignore future/unstarted H2H fixtures and skip enrichment cleanly when team IDs are unavailable
- tests: cover H2H parsing, ordering, compact output, canonical request parameters and cache lifetime

## v3.9.1 (2026-07-23)
- entity IDs: sanitize competition/team-derived object IDs to Home Assistant's supported lowercase ASCII format
- compatibility: valid existing IDs remain unchanged; characters such as `#`, parentheses and accents are normalized safely
- tests: cover the reported `Eredivisie #88 (Netherlands)` warning and accented club names

## v3.9.0 (2026-07-23)
- testing: add `soccer_live.simulate_match_event` for safe lifecycle, goal, card and lineup automation testing
- safety: simulated events always carry `simulated: true` and never mutate sensors, caches, provider state or deduplication storage
- service UI: add Home Assistant selectors and defaults for all supported test-event fields
- tests: cover event mapping, normalized phases and deterministic simulated payloads

## v3.8.0 (2026-07-23)
- match contract: expose provider-neutral `match_phase` values and annotate every published match
- active fixture: add `current_match` separately while preserving the existing `next_match` contract
- events: add `soccer_live_halftime` and include `event_id`/`match_phase` in start and finish payloads
- compatibility: retain all existing states and attributes; high-churn `current_match` data stays out of recorder history

## v3.7.1 (2026-07-22)
- recorder: exclude transient `club_changes` from state-history attributes; change events remain the automation signal
- club monitoring: suppress market-value noise below €100,000 or 1% of the previous squad value
- tests: make the club-change module test runnable standalone without importing Home Assistant

## v3.7.0 (2026-07-22)
- club monitoring: compare persisted daily club snapshots and expose transient `club_changes` for new transfers, injuries, recoveries, coach changes, squad changes and market-value changes
- events: fire `soccer_live_club_change` plus specific `soccer_live_<change_type>` events when a real club snapshot transition is detected; the first snapshot never produces false alerts
- lineups: fire `soccer_live_lineup_available` once when a fixture transitions from no lineup to an available lineup, including both player lists for automation filtering
- tests: add pure snapshot/diff and lineup-transition coverage

## v3.6.108 (2026-07-21)
- matches: expose a stable `is_friendly` flag on each match (ESPN and API-Football), derived from the raw English league name. Cards can rely on this instead of guessing from the (possibly localised) competition name, which avoids false positives and makes the friendly-logo handling language-independent

## v3.6.107 (2026-07-21)
- config flow: fixed the "could not load competitions/teams" abort messages being placed under `options.abort` (where Home Assistant never looks them up) in English, Dutch and Portuguese — they are raised in the config flow, so they now live under `config.abort` in every language. German/French/Spanish/Italian already had them there but were missing the reauth step, the reauth-success message and the "change API key" option label; all are now filled in
- translations: added `strings.json` (the canonical English source Home Assistant expects) mirroring `translations/en.json`
- tests: added a `strings.json` == `en.json` check and a full language-parity test that compares every leaf key of English against nl/de/fr/es/it/pt, so no language can silently lag behind on any string (with an explicit allow-list for intentional exceptions, currently empty)

## v3.6.106 (2026-07-21)
- entity names: added the localised sensor/calendar names for German, French, Spanish and Italian (previously only English and Dutch had them, so those languages fell back to English)
- translations: added a full Portuguese (`pt`) translation, so the integration now offers the same languages as the cards (en, nl, de, fr, es, it, pt)
- cleanup: removed the now-unused `SENSOR_TYPE_NAMES` / `friendly_sensor_name()` from `const.py`. The translation files are the single source of truth for entity names; the tests now assert every supported language provides a name for every sensor type and the calendar (and that the key sets match)

## v3.6.105 (2026-07-21)
- calendar: the events cache now fingerprints each match's kickoff, live state and score (not just the list length and first/last time), so a match going pre → in → post or a score update refreshes the calendar entry instead of showing a stale "Team - Team" without the score
- options: changing the API-Football key is now atomic — the key is only written once every field validates, so an invalid date (or other error) in the same submit no longer leaves the key already changed while the form reports failure
- entities: sensor and calendar names are now localised via `translation_key` (entity name translations), so Dutch users see "Volgende wedstrijd", "Alle competities", "Wedstrijdkalender", etc. instead of the hardcoded English names (other languages fall back to English)
- status: dropped the unobservable "fetching" state from the polled sensor — a polled entity only publishes attributes after the update finishes, so the first load is reported as "initializing" (the card shows the same "fetching…" text). "fetching" stays reserved for a future push-based coordinator

## v3.6.104 (2026-07-21)
- calendar: fixed slow state updates ("Updating state for calendar.… took N seconds") that could block the event loop. The parsed/sorted events are now cached between refreshes and only rebuilt when the underlying match list actually changes (both `event` and `async_get_events` reuse the cache), and kickoff times are parsed with the fast stdlib ISO path instead of the slower dateutil fallback

## v3.6.103 (2026-07-21)
- card contract: sensors now publish `integration_version`, `data_schema_version` and `recommended_card_types` (the card `card_type` slugs that suit each sensor type), so the card can recommend the right card for a selected entity and warn when the integration is outdated. Read from the manifest at import (no hardcoded version). Pure `recommended_card_types` helper with tests

## v3.6.102 (2026-07-21)
- status: each sensor now publishes a `sync_status` attribute with the lifecycle state — `initializing`, `fetching`, `ready`, `rate_limited`, `authentication_failed` or `provider_unavailable`. This lets a card show concrete text (e.g. "fetching matches for the first time") during the first update instead of an empty card that looks like a misconfiguration
- status: the value is derived with clear precedence (auth failure and rate limiting first; then no-data states distinguishing a fetch in progress, an idle first-load window and an unreachable provider; otherwise `ready`). Pure `compute_sync_status` helper with unit tests

## v3.6.101 (2026-07-21)
- API-Football key recovery: when the key is rejected (HTTP 401/403 or an `errors.token` body), the integration now starts a **reauth flow** so you can enter a new key without deleting the config. Home Assistant shows its standard reauth prompt (a repair/notification), and the key/team selection is preserved
- API-Football key recovery: added a **"Change API-Football key"** field in the integration options (validated on save) to replace an expired/revoked key at any time
- status: sensors now report a specific `api_status: authentication_failed` and a clear `last_error` ("API-Football API key is invalid") on an auth failure, instead of just returning empty data. The reauth flow is started once per entry (not on every poll) and cleared on the next successful update
- tests: added coverage for reauth (valid/invalid key), the options key change (valid/invalid, hidden for ESPN), and an `is_auth_error` parser helper that distinguishes a token error from a quota/parameter error

## v3.6.100 (2026-07-20)
- entities: sensors now have short, human-readable names (**Next match**, **All matches**, **All competitions**, **Standings**, …) via `has_entity_name`, so the device (e.g. *Soccer Live · Feyenoord*) supplies the context. The verbose `entity_id` is pinned and unchanged, so existing dashboards and automations keep working
- entities: the fixtures calendar is now named **Match calendar** and grouped under the same device as the entry's sensors (previously a standalone "Soccer Live <team>" entity); its `entity_id` is preserved
- devices: a team entry's device now reads *Soccer Live · <team>* instead of the raw competition code
- docs: added a "Which sensor do I need?" section (Team/Countdown/Match Center → `next_*`; Team Competitions & extended schedules → `all_mixed_*`; competition views → `all_*`) and a Quick start block
- tests: added coverage for the friendly sensor-name mapping and its title-cased fallback

## v3.6.99 (2026-07-20)
- config flow: split the single first step into a simpler wizard. Step 1 now only asks for the data source (ESPN — free, no API key — is the recommended default). API-Football key, season and friendlies are asked in a dedicated follow-up step, so ESPN users no longer see API-Football options that don't apply to them
- config flow: "what to follow" is now its own step with **Team** as the default, and it only offers options the chosen provider supports — e.g. "News" is no longer selectable for API-Football (it was ESPN-only and previously failed only after submitting)
- config flow: translations updated for the new `user` / `api_football_credentials` / `follow` steps in English and Dutch (other languages fall back to English for the new steps)
- tests: rewrote the config-flow tests for the split flow and added first-install coverage (ESPN team → competition select, API-Football team → search, invalid/missing key, News filtered out for API-Football, and that the new steps have English and Dutch labels)

## v3.6.98 (2026-07-20)
- rate limiting: when a per-day quota pause is set, the per-minute backoff is now cleared, so a stale minute backoff isn't carried into the next day. Added tests (with an injected clock) that the daily pause actually ends at the next UTC midnight

## v3.6.97 (2026-07-20)
- rate limiting: distinguish a per-day quota exhaustion from a per-minute burst — a daily limit now pauses enrichment until the next quota reset (~UTC midnight) instead of retrying every 30 minutes all day; per-minute limits keep the doubling backoff. Added a parser test for ESPN `timeValid: false` (time_tbd) and a daily-limit test

## v3.6.96 (2026-07-20)
- matches: expose a `time_tbd` flag on each match (from ESPN's `timeValid`), so cards can show "unknown" for fixtures whose kick-off time isn't confirmed yet instead of a placeholder time

## v3.6.95 (2026-07-20)
- rate limiting: an API-Football rate limit is now logged at INFO instead of WARNING (so Home Assistant no longer surfaces it as a custom-integration error) — it's an expected, self-healing condition where the last cached data keeps being served. Only the first hit (when not already paused) logs and starts the backoff; concurrent stragglers from the same burst (e.g. right after a restart) are dropped to DEBUG and no longer balloon the backoff. The pause is still visible in diagnostics

## v3.6.94 (2026-07-20)
- rate limiting: API-Football reports per-minute/per-day limits as an HTTP 200 body error ("Too many requests…"), not an HTTP 429, so these previously only logged a warning and the burst continued. They now trigger the same shared enrichment backoff as a 429, so once any sensor hits the limit all sensors pause enrichment — fixing the flood of errors right after a Home Assistant restart when every sensor enriches at once

## v3.6.93 (2026-07-18)
- shared card defaults: new options (shared card appearance, palette, compact mode and language) are published on every sensor as a `card_defaults` attribute, so multiple Soccer Live cards on the same sensor can inherit one look/preference instead of being configured individually. A card's own setting always overrides the shared default; the attribute is unrecorded

## v3.6.92 (2026-07-18)
- predictions: round comparison percentages instead of truncating (so 28.6/71.4 becomes 29/71, not 28/71), and drop the `total` metric — it largely repeated form/attack/defense and added height. The predicted goal lines are still exposed raw (`goals_home`/`goals_away`/`under_over`); the card now formats them as thresholds rather than labelling them "expected goals"

## v3.6.91 (2026-07-18)
- predictions: surface more of the data already returned by `/predictions` (no extra API requests). The prediction now also carries a home-vs-away strength `comparison` (form/attack/defense/overall percentages) and the predicted goal lines (`goals_home`/`goals_away`/`under_over`)

## v3.6.90 (2026-07-18)
- club cache: version the persisted club blob and reject blobs written by an
  older code version, so a parsing fix (e.g. the coach selection) lands on the
  next refetch instead of being masked by the 24h cache. Bumped for the coach fix
  in v3.6.89, so the correct current coach appears right after upgrading

## v3.6.89 (2026-07-18)
- club coach: fix the current head coach being wrong (e.g. Feyenoord showing a former assistant). `/coachs?team=X` lists everyone who coached the team and each coach's whole career, so a former coach now in charge elsewhere could win. We now only weigh career spells at the queried team, prefer an open one, and break ties on the most recent start
- live odds: made opt-in. New `enable_live_odds` option (default off, shown only for providers with the new `live_odds` capability) because `/odds/live` polls often. When off, live matches keep showing the last pre-match odds via the snapshot re-attach (no extra requests). The feature pauses itself on HTTP 403 (plan doesn't include it) for 6h and after several empty responses for 1h, independent of the 429 backoff. Diagnostics now expose `live_odds_calls`, `live_odds_last_status` and `live_odds_paused_until`

## v3.6.88 (2026-07-18)
- live odds (API-Football): once a match is live, fetch the real in-play `/odds/live` 1X2 feed instead of the pre-match `/odds` (which API-Football drops at kick-off), so the odds shown during the game are actually live rather than a frozen pre-match snapshot. Tagged `live` on the odds, cached 45s (dedups sensors on the same fixture), suspended markets (stopped/blocked/individually suspended) return nothing so the last shown odds stay. Only runs while a match is live and rides the existing 429 backoff

## v3.6.87 (2026-07-18)
- top assists (API-Football): the top scorers sensor now fetches the real `/players/topassists` ranking and exposes it as a separate `assists` attribute, instead of the Scorers card re-sorting the top scorers by their assists (which missed assist leaders with few goals). Cached 6h and marked unrecorded
- club data: moved behind its own `enable_club_data` option (default on) instead of piggybacking on `enable_summary_enrichment`, and the option only appears for providers that support it via `provider_supports()`. Added a `club` provider capability
- club cache: the assembled club blob is now persisted to HA storage with a timestamp and re-used while younger than 24h, so a restart no longer spends four requests per team sensor on startup
- transfers: drop duplicate records via a composite key (player + date + from + to)

## v3.6.86 (2026-07-18)
- club data (API-Football, team sensors): attach a club attribute with the team profile (venue, founded, country), current coach, full squad (sorted by position then shirt number) and recent transfers (in/out, player, fee, date). Fetched from /teams, /coachs, /players/squads and /transfers, cached 24h (~4 requests/day), and marked unrecorded. Feeds the upcoming Club card

## v3.6.85 (2026-07-17)
- providers: add a declarative `PROVIDER_CAPABILITIES` map and a `provider_supports()` helper, and expose the selected provider's capabilities as the `provider_capabilities` sensor attribute, so cards and automations can adapt to what the provider actually supports (ESPN: news/brackets; API-Football: predictions/odds/injuries/top_assists/xg)

## v3.6.84 (2026-07-17)
- rate limiting: fix a race where an in-flight enrichment request that started before a concurrent HTTP 429 could clear a fresh backoff — the backoff is now only reset once the pause window has elapsed and a request succeeds
- pre-match data: persist the prediction/odds/injuries/standing snapshot to HA storage (debounced), so a Home Assistant restart during a match no longer loses this context

## v3.6.83 (2026-07-17)
- pre-match data: also fetch the prediction/injuries/standing for the live match itself (API-Football keeps returning them during the game), not only the next upcoming match — so the prediction shows during a match that was already live when the update landed. The pre-match snapshot cache now merges, so pre-match odds (which API-Football drops once live) are retained

## v3.6.82 (2026-07-17)
- pre-match data: cache the prediction/odds/injuries/standing snapshot per fixture id and re-attach it once the match goes live (or is rebuilt from /fixtures), so this context stays visible during the game without any new API requests. Previously these fields were only present while the match was still upcoming

## v3.6.81 (2026-07-17)
- rate limiting: on an API-Football HTTP 429, new enrichment requests are paused with an exponential backoff (60s doubling up to 30 min, reset on the next success) while the last cached data keeps being served, so sections don't disappear. The pause state (`enrichment_paused_until`) is exposed in diagnostics

## v3.6.80 (2026-07-17)
- recorder: mark the large, high-churn attributes (`matches`, `previous_matches`, `upcoming_matches`, `next_match`, `schedule_*`, `standings_groups`, `scorers`, `articles`, `rounds`, `head_to_head`, `league_info`, `last_*_event`) as unrecorded, so they no longer bloat the Home Assistant database. The sensor state and small scalar attributes are still recorded

## v3.6.79 (2026-07-17)
- diagnostics: add an `api_football` section for monitoring API usage — per-endpoint call counts and cache hits, last successful update and last HTTP status per endpoint, endpoint cache size, and a `rate_limited_at` marker set on HTTP 429. Helps diagnose why a pre-match section is temporarily missing

## v3.6.78 (2026-07-17)
- calendar: sensors now publish their match list to a shared per-entry store, and the calendar reads from it directly instead of depending on entity states/registry selection (entity-scan kept as a fallback). Makes the calendar independent of entity availability

## v3.6.77 (2026-07-16)
- sensor: expose API-Football standings as structured `home_rank`/`home_points`/`away_rank`/`away_points` fields instead of a pre-formatted string, so the cards can format and localize the label themselves

## v3.6.76 (2026-07-16)
- calendar: add a calendar platform — each config entry now exposes a calendar entity with the team/competition fixtures as events (kick-off, teams, venue, competition; score for finished matches), reusing the match data the sensors already fetch. Enables the HA calendar view and time-based (Calendar trigger) automations

## v3.6.75 (2026-07-16)
- sensor: populate `home_standing_summary`/`away_standing_summary` for API-Football matches (league position + points, e.g. "#2 · 65 pts") via the /standings endpoint for the next upcoming match; the Team card already renders these. Cached 6h, only for league matches (friendlies have no standings)

## v3.6.74 (2026-07-16)
- blueprints: add yellow card, substitution, full time (final score) and configurable kick-off reminder notification blueprints, alongside the existing goal / red card / match started ones

## v3.6.73 (2026-07-16)
- parser: normalize the API-Football `expected_goals` statistic to home/away `expectedGoals` so cards can show xG alongside possession and shots (for leagues where API-Football provides xG)

## v3.6.72 (2026-07-16)
- sensor: attach averaged 1X2 odds (home/draw/away from the Match Winner market, across bookmakers) to the next upcoming match via API-Football `/odds`; cached 1h, attached only when odds exist (API-Football carries odds ~1–14 days pre-match, generally not for friendlies)

## v3.6.71 (2026-07-16)
- parser: suppress API-Football's neutral placeholder prediction (equal percentages with no named winner, e.g. 33/33/33) so nothing is attached until a meaningful prediction exists

## v3.6.70 (2026-07-16)
- sensor: attach per-team injuries/suspensions (player + reason + `suspended` flag) to the next upcoming match via API-Football `/injuries`; fetched in parallel with predictions/odds, attached only when data exists

## v3.6.69 (2026-07-16)
- sensor: attach a pre-match `prediction` (home/draw/away win percentages + betting advice) to the next upcoming match via API-Football `/predictions`; one call, cached 6h, attached only when data exists

## v3.6.68 (2026-07-15)
- parser: ESPN match model now includes `date_iso` (raw ISO kickoff) alongside the localized display date, enabling kickoff-time weather forecasts in the cards

## v3.6.67 (2026-07-11)
- parser: flatten ESPN object scores (`{value, displayValue}`) to their display value in the live match model and head-to-head list — fixes "[object Object]" scores on live ESPN matches

## v3.6.66 (2026-07-10)
- sensor: single-match cards no longer fetch API-Football enrichment for upcoming matches more than 3h away (those endpoints are empty until close to kickoff), saving daily API quota
- diagnostics: config-entry diagnostics now include provider, api_status, last_error and the API-Football quota (the API key itself is never included, only a `has_api_football_key` boolean)

## v3.6.65 (2026-07-10)
- sensor: goal detection now attributes scored penalties for both providers (ESPN "Penalty - Scored", API-Football "Goal - Penalty"); missed penalties and VAR-disallowed goals stay excluded

## v3.6.64 (2026-07-10)
- parser: API-Football missed penalties now read "Penalty - Missed" and no longer count as a scoring play; scored penalties are written as "Goal - Penalty" so the scorer/minute reach the goal notification

## v3.6.63 (2026-07-10)
- parser: API-Football `league_name`/`competition_name` are localized to Home Assistant's language (e.g. "Friendlies Clubs" → "Oefenwedstrijd"); the raw name is kept for the friendlies filter and `league_info`

## v3.6.62 (2026-07-10)
- sensor: surface API-Football error payloads (HTTP 200 with a top-level `errors` field) to `last_error` and the log instead of caching them as valid-but-empty data; warn on HTTP 429 rate limits

## v3.6.61 (2026-07-10)
- sensor: the live match clock now includes stoppage time (e.g. 90+4)
- parser: topscorer goals/assists are summed across clubs for players transferred mid-season

## v3.6.60 (2026-07-05)
- config flow: add matching `config/error` translations (all six languages) so first-time setup shows proper messages instead of raw keys; validate the API-Football key during setup (fails open on transient network errors)

## v3.6.59 (2026-07-05)
- parser: keep stoppage time in API-Football `match_details`; normalize pre-match incidents (negative `elapsed`) to `N/A`; misc cleanups (event formatter params, O(n²) lineup tagging, module-level stat-key table)

## v3.6.58 (2026-07-05)
- provider: add optional API-Football support alongside ESPN, including provider setup, API key handling, direct team search, season selection and friendlies filtering
- sensor: API-Football supports team fixtures (`team_match`, `team_matches`, `team_matches_mixed`), competition fixtures, all matches today, standings and top scorers; news and knockout brackets remain ESPN-only
- sensor: API-Football match enrichment fetches fixture events, statistics and lineups for team sensors, including recent finished matches so card popups can show scorers/cards after full time
- sensor: add configurable `live_scan_interval` option (`30` / `45` / `60` / `90` / `120` seconds); live-mode main response cache now follows the selected interval when lower than 60 seconds
- parser: add API-Football parser and normalize event/detail strings to the existing Soccer Live match contract
- docs/tests: document provider behavior, quota-related caching and live polling; add config-flow, parser and sensor regression coverage

## v3.6.49 (2026-06-30)
- parser: `home_form` and `away_form` now default to `""` instead of `"N/A"` when ESPN does not supply form data — prevents cards from rendering spurious dots for the literal characters N, / and A

## v3.6.48 (2026-06-30)
- sensor: schedule `compact()` now includes `clock`, `league_logo`, and `season_info` — live match clock, competition logo, and round info are now available in `schedule_live_matches`, `schedule_upcoming_matches`, and `schedule_recent_matches` for use in HA templates and automations

## v3.6.47 (2026-06-30)
- sensor: `previous_matches` compact dict now includes `league_name` and `season_info` — required for competition label and phase display in the Team card
- sensor: `upcoming_matches` compact dict now includes `home_form`, `away_form`, and `league_name` — required for opponent form dots and competition label in the Team card

## v3.6.45 (2026-06-26)
- bracket: add `"round-of-64"` to slug_map so ESPN's Round of 64 events pass the single-leg filter
- bracket: add `32: "Round of 64"` to the canonical size→name dict

## v3.6.44 (2026-06-26)
- sensor: removed `commentary` sensor type — no card uses it since LiveCommentary was removed from the card repo; removes the `_enrich_with_commentary` fetch and the `if selection == "Live Commentary"` setup path
- config_flow: removed "Live Commentary" option from the integration setup menu

## v3.6.43 (2026-06-25)
- parser: `_get_details` now uses `(detail.get("type") or {})` and `(detail.get("clock") or {})` — prevents `AttributeError` when ESPN returns `null` for these fields instead of an object

## v3.6.42 (2026-06-25)
- sensor: `_extract_all_goal_scorers` now excludes `"Goal Disallowed"` strings — disallowed goals no longer appear in `goal_scorers_str` of the `match_finished` event
- sensor: `compact()` in `_compute_schedule_summary` now includes `league_name` so `schedule_upcoming_matches`, `schedule_live_matches`, and `schedule_recent_matches` carry competition info (relevant for `team_matches_mixed` sensors)

## v3.6.41 (2026-06-24)
- sensor: `sort_key` in `_compute_schedule_summary` now returns a timezone-aware `datetime.max` fallback so matches with unparseable dates no longer cause a `TypeError` when sorted alongside valid aware datetimes
- sensor: `_pick_goal_strings` now excludes `"Goal Disallowed"` strings so VAR-cancelled goals cannot be attributed as real goal scorers
- sensor: `_pick_goal_strings` now returns the *most-recent* undispatched strings (`[-count:]`) instead of the oldest — prevents a late-arriving goal string from a previous goal being picked up as the scorer for the next goal

## v3.6.40 (2026-06-24)
- sensor: `_filter_start_str` / `_filter_end_str` return `None` when no date is configured instead of calling `strftime()` on `None` and crashing
- sensor: URL building omits the ESPN `dates` parameter when neither calendar nor configured dates provide a complete range, preventing the remaining `strftime()` crash
- sensor: fetch lock pruning now preserves locks that are currently held (`v.locked()`) so an in-progress fetch is never evicted from `_fetch_locks`, eliminating the remaining race condition
- sensor: ESPN responses are cached only after successful processing, so malformed payloads cannot poison the shared cache
- parsers: match, standings, league, news, scorers and bracket parsers now re-raise internal errors instead of silently returning empty data — the sensor catches the exception and correctly sets `api_status = error`
- config_flow: competition and team responses are normalized defensively; null, non-object and incomplete entries are skipped instead of crashing with KeyError/TypeError
- tests: add regressions for empty date filters, failed-response caching, parser failures and malformed competition/team responses

## v3.6.39 (2026-06-24)
- sensor: introduce `_process_and_apply()` helper used by all three code paths (cache hit, lock double-check, network fetch) so `last_event` attributes are preserved on every update path, not just the cache path
- sensor: per-URL `_fetch_lock` (mirrors `_calendar_locks`) prevents concurrent sensors sharing the same ESPN URL from issuing duplicate network requests; a double-check inside the lock processes cached data when available
- sensor: store key now includes `config_entry_id` so two identical config entries each keep their own `match_finished` dispatched-event file and cannot overwrite each other
- config_flow: empty team list now returns `async_abort(reason="no_teams")` instead of presenting an unusable empty dropdown; translated in all 6 languages

## v3.6.38 (2026-06-24)
- sensor: goal attribution now uses `[ABBREV]` tag from ESPN detail strings to match goals to the correct team; falls back to positional order when tag is absent
- sensor: `last_event`, `last_goal_event`, `last_card_event` and related attributes now survive the next update cycle — carried forward until a new event of the same type overwrites them
- sensor: push notifications now use `minute` (not `clock`) for goal/card events, and `league_name` (not `competition_name`) for match-finished events
- config_flow: `{"sports": []}` no longer raises `IndexError` in the teams step
- config_flow: empty competition list now returns an `async_abort` instead of showing a broken empty dropdown; translated in all 6 languages

## v3.6.37 (2026-06-24)
- sensor: simultaneous goals now correctly attributed — home claims only `goals_scored` strings from the timeline, leaving the rest for away; `_extract_goal_scorers_from_details` simplified to work on the pre-filtered list
- scoreboard: prefer `competition.status` over `event.status` for match state, clock and period so a live match with status only in `competitions[0]` is no longer treated as N/A
- scoreboard: date filter interprets user-supplied `start_date`/`end_date` in the HA timezone instead of UTC, preventing midnight-local matches from being included or excluded by the wrong UTC day
- standings: handle both `seasons` (array) and `season` (singular object) fixture shapes; read `league_name`/`abbreviation` from `leagues[0]` as fallback when not present at the top level

## v3.6.36 (2026-06-24)
- scoreboard: `home_record`, `home_top_scorer`, `home_record_summary`, `home_standing_summary` and their away equivalents now use `home_comp`/`away_comp` — the remaining `competitors[0]`/`[1]` references were missed in v3.6.35
- scoreboard: `is_within_recent_window` adds 2 h to the configured window so the threshold is measured from match end (kickoff + ~2 h) rather than kickoff; a match with a 6 h window that kicked off 7 h ago and ended 5 h ago is now correctly shown
- sensor: `_extract_goal_scorers_from_details` now accepts an `exclude` set so home-goal strings are excluded when extracting the away scorer — prevents the same player from being attributed to both teams when both score in one poll cycle

## v3.6.35 (2026-06-24)
- scoreboard: use `homeAway` field from ESPN to correctly assign home and away competitors — was always taking `competitors[0]` as home, swapping teams in roughly half of matches
- scoreboard: `is_within_recent_window()` now compares naive local datetimes — the stored date string is local time (formatted by `_parse_date`), but the previous code treated it as UTC, causing 1–2 h drift depending on timezone
- sensor: goal deduplication now uses a per-match `_dispatched_goal_details` set instead of `max()` — a real goal scored after a disallowed goal (score reverts and rises again) was silently dropped
- sensor: sensor state for a post-match now reads `"Last match: X 2 - 1 Y"` instead of `"Next match: X vs Y"` — the `else` branch was also covering the `post` state

## v3.6.34 (2026-06-24)
- sensor: `match_finished` events now only fire on a known `in→post` transition; historical finished matches on first poll are silently skipped to prevent notification spam on new installs or cleared storage
- sensor: score corrections no longer trigger duplicate goal events — track the highest score seen per match so a score that dips and recovers to a known value does not re-fire
- sensor: `upcoming_matches` now starts from the first `pre`/`in` match when `next_match` is a recently finished match (was always skipping index 0, hiding the first upcoming fixture)
- sensor: invalid JSON from ESPN now sets `_last_error` and breaks the retry loop instead of propagating an unhandled exception that left `api_status` stale

## v3.6.33 (2026-06-24)
- config_flow: validate `start_date`/`end_date` format (YYYY-MM-DD) and `start ≤ end` before saving options; error messages in all 6 languages
- sensor: guard `datetime.strptime` with try/except so a bad stored date disables the filter with a warning instead of crashing sensor init
- sensor: set `_last_error` on HTTP 4xx (except expected 404 for top_scorers) so `api_status` correctly shows `error` instead of `ok`
- scoreboard: use `.astimezone(UTC)` instead of `.replace(tzinfo=UTC)` for timezone-aware dates — `17:00+02:00` now correctly becomes `15:00 UTC` instead of `17:00 UTC`
- integration: remove accidental `package-lock.json` (Python project, not Node)

## v3.6.32 (2026-06-24)
- sensor: parse errors no longer mark the update as successful — `api_status` now correctly stays `error` when `_process_data` raises an exception (was: `_last_error` set in except block then immediately overwritten to `None`)
- scoreboard: end-date filter now uses `23:59:59` instead of `00:00:00` — matches on the last day were excluded when scheduled after midnight UTC
- translations: remove unused `strings.json` (HA reads from `en.json`; duplicate file caused confusion)

## v3.6.31 (2026-06-23)
- scoreboard: replace hardcoded Dutch `team_name` fallback `"Alle wedstrijden"` with `"All matches"` — this string is a visible sensor attribute in HA

## v3.6.30 (2026-06-23)
- config_flow: catch `asyncio.TimeoutError` alongside `aiohttp.ClientError` — timeouts during setup/team-search no longer cause an unhandled exception
- config_flow: switch log calls from f-strings to `%s` lazy formatting
- sensor: translate remaining Dutch/Italian hardcoded state strings to English (`"Volgende wedstrijd"`, `"Geen wedstrijden beschikbaar"`)
- sensor/scoreboard: translate remaining Italian/Dutch docstrings and inline comments to English
- hassfest workflow: pin `actions/checkout` to `v7.0.0` consistent with other workflows

## v3.6.29 (2026-06-23)
- Prune `_calendar_cache` and `_calendar_locks` class-level dicts each update cycle — entries older than 5 minutes are removed and orphaned locks are dropped, preventing unbounded memory growth

## v3.6.28 (2026-06-22)
- Add URL-building regression tests for calendar/no-calendar sensor types
- Throttle repeated calendar fetch warnings per competition and error reason for 5 minutes

## v3.6.27 (2026-06-22)
- Reduce unnecessary ESPN calendar calls by only fetching calendar dates for date-range scoreboard sensors
- Add per-competition calendar caching and locking to prevent startup bursts across related sensors
- Improve calendar fetch logging: timeouts and HTTP/client errors now include sensor name, URL and error type instead of an empty message

## v3.6.16 (2026-06-20)
- Add Home Assistant automation blueprints for goal, red card and match started notifications

## v3.6.15 (2026-06-20)
- Docs: document health attributes, automation last-event attributes, schedule summary attributes and new match color/count fields

## v3.6.14 (2026-06-20)
- Automation attributes: expose `last_event`, `last_event_type`, `last_event_timestamp` and typed last-event attributes for goals, cards, match started and match finished
- Health attributes: expose `last_successful_update`, `last_error` and `api_status`
- Schedule summary: expose deduplicated `schedule_*` counts and compact live/upcoming/recent match lists

## v3.6.13 (2026-06-20)
- Match sensors: expose top-level home/away colors and `team_colors` for card auto-skins
- Match sensors: expose next/live match abbreviations, event IDs, event counts, H2H counts and broadcast counts for richer cards and automations

## v3.6.12 (2026-06-19)
- `standings` sensor: remove fallback ESPN logo URL construction — ESPN uses numeric IDs not competition code strings, causing 404 errors; card now shows fallback emoji instead

## v3.6.11 (2026-06-19)
- `standings` sensor: when ESPN standings API returns no logo, construct fallback URL from competition code (`espncdn.com/leaguelogos/soccer/500/{code}.png`)
- `standings` sensor: state changed from Dutch "Stand" to "Standings"
- `standings` parser: broader logo extraction (tries top-level `logos`, then `leagues[0].logos`)

## v3.6.10 (2026-06-19)
- `standings` parser: include `league_logo` from ESPN logos array
- `bracket` sensor: include `league_logo` and `league_name` from `process_league_data`
- `match_day` sensor: include `league_logo`; state changed from Dutch "Speelronde" to "Match day"
- `commentary` sensor: include `league_logo`; state no longer says "Geen live wedstrijd" — now "No live match"
- `news` sensor: include `league_name` and empty `league_logo`; state no longer says "artikelen" — now "articles"

## v3.6.9 (2026-06-19)
- Fix Dutch sensor state strings: `"tegen"` → `"vs"`, `"wedstrijden beschikbaar"` → `"matches available"`, `"Geen wedstrijden beschikbaar"` → `"No matches available"`

## v3.6.8 (2026-06-19)
- `bracket.py`: remove dead `round_name_nl`/`name_nl` Dutch fields; simplify slug/canonical tuples to plain strings; translate Italian docstrings to English
- `sensor.py`: bracket sensor state now uses English — `"Round of 16 (16 teams)"` instead of `"Round of 16 (16 ploegen)"`; fallback `"Bracket unavailable"` instead of `"Bracket niet beschikbaar"`

## v3.6.7 (2026-06-19)
- README: `league_info` attribute added to data contract table
- Config-flow: `commentary` setup step added to all 6 translation files (was missing — showed blank UI)
- Comments in `bracket.py`, `standings.py`, `sensor.py` translated to English

## v3.6.6 (2026-06-18)
- Add `icon.png` inside component directory so the HA update entity shows the integration icon

## v3.6.5 (2026-06-18)
- `league_info` objects now include a `name` field (ESPN full league name, e.g. "FIFA World Cup") — Countdown card uses this to display the competition name

## v3.6.4 (2026-06-18)
- Translate remaining NL/IT inline comments in sensor.py to English

## v3.6.3 (2026-06-18)
- All remaining Dutch/Italian log messages translated to English (goal/card/substitution/match events in sensor.py)
- URL-based shared fetch cache: sensors sharing the same ESPN endpoint now share one fetch per cache window instead of fetching separately
- Parser tests added (17 passing): scoreboard and standings parsers tested against minimal ESPN fixtures; direct module import bypasses HA's `__init__.py`

## v3.6.2 (2026-06-18)
- All log messages standardized to English (IT/NL strings in sensor.py and parsers)
- Data contract table added to README: match object attributes, enriched sensor fields, top-level `next_match_*` attributes

## v3.6.1 (2026-06-17)
- Pass `enable_summary_enrichment` and `max_matches` to all sensor constructors (were read from options but not forwarded)
- Translation labels for `enable_summary_enrichment`, `max_matches`, `notify_service` added in all 7 languages
- `next_match_has_stats`/`next_match_has_commentary` use parser flags with fallback to statistics/events presence
- Diagnostics: `sensor_type` now read reliably from state attributes (works for `team_matches_mixed`, `all_matches_today`, etc.)
- `sensor_type` added as explicit state attribute on every sensor

## v3.6.0 (2026-06-17)

### Bug fix (high priority)
- `_parse_match_datetime()` now tries both `%d-%m-%Y %H:%M` and `%d/%m/%Y %H:%M` — mismatch was causing `next_match_datetime_iso` and `next_match_minutes_until` to always return `N/A`/`None`

### New top-level attributes
- `next_match_broadcasts` — list of TV/streaming channels
- `next_match_attendance`, `next_match_neutral_site`, `next_match_has_stats`, `next_match_has_commentary`, `next_match_links`, `next_match_week`

### Diagnostics
- `diagnostics.py` added — download via HA Settings → Integrations → Soccer Live; includes competition code, sensor types, request count, match count, cache age (no large match payloads)

### Options flow
- `enable_summary_enrichment` (default: on) — disable to skip ESPN summary endpoint and reduce API calls
- `max_matches` (0/5/10/15/20/30, default: 0 = unlimited) — caps `matches` list to reduce recorder payload

## v3.5.6 (2026-06-17)
- Normalise indentation in `_fetch_match_summary` and `_get_calendar_data` HTTP session blocks

## v3.5.5 (2026-06-17)
- Fix indentation in HTTP session blocks in `sensor.py` and `config_flow.py` (normalised after aiohttp migration)

## v3.5.4 (2026-06-17)
- Use `async_get_clientsession(hass)` instead of bare `aiohttp.ClientSession()` in sensor + config_flow
- `_scorers_unavailable` now correctly set to `True` on 404 — sensor skips subsequent requests

## v3.5.3 (2026-06-17)
- Team matching on ESPN `team_id` (competitor ID) when available; falls back to name matching
- Parser: `process_match_data()` accepts `team_id` parameter

## v3.5.2 (2026-06-16)
- Fix: `scoreboard.py` skips matches with `< 2 competitors` (postponed/incomplete ESPN events no longer crash the entire sensor update)

## v3.5.1 (2026-06-16)
- Live polling: sensors with active matches refresh automatically every 60 s (in addition to base interval)
- Live polling only applies to live-capable sensor types; standings/scorers/news/bracket unaffected
- `manifest.json` version synced to `3.5.0` (was `3.4.2`)
- `hacs.json`: description added

## v3.5.0 (2026-06-15)
- Standings: `zone_color`, `zone_label`, `zone_abbrev` from `entry.note` per team
- Scoreboard: `home/away_record_summary`, `home/away_standing_summary` from competitors
- Scoreboard: `broadcasts` (full list), `neutral_site`, `tickets_available` per match
- Scoreboard: `has_stats` (boxscoreAvailable), `has_commentary` (playByPlayAvailable)
- Scoreboard: `match_links` compact dict `{summary, commentary, stats, video}`
- Scoreboard: `week_number` from `events[].week.number`
- Summary: `last_five_home`/`last_five_away` from `boxscore.players[].statistics`
- News: `byline`, `last_modified`, `image_caption`, `image_credit`, `tags`, `premium`
- Top scorers 404: clear INFO log
- `manifest.json` version synced to 3.4.2
- News: `byline`, `last_modified`, `image_caption`, `image_credit`, `tags`, `premium`
- Top scorers 404: clear INFO log (not an error, ESPN doesn't support all competitions)

## v3.3.0 (2026-06-15)
- `async_step_campionato` → `async_step_league`, `step_id="campionato"` → `"league"` (all 7 translation files)
- `nome_squadra` / `nome_squadra_normalizzato` → `display_name_input` / `display_name_normalized`
- Italian error messages and comments in `parsers/scoreboard.py` → English
- All `CalcioLive*` class names in card code → `SoccerLive*`
- Releases consolidated: removed 30+ micro-releases

## v3.2.0 (2026-06-15)

## v3.1.2 (2026-06-15)
- Event tracking now uses `event_id` as primary key (fallback to team names)
- Prevents false deduplication on rematches, friendlies or team name changes

## v3.1.1 (2026-06-15)
- `_process_data` fully pure: events collected via passed `events: list` parameter
- All `_detect_and_dispatch_*` and `_dispatch_*` methods no longer mutate `self._pending_events`
- `self._save_store_needed` derived from events on event loop instead of set in executor
- Fallback return fixed: no longer reads `self._state` / `self._attributes`

## v3.1.0 (2026-06-15)
- Rename `sensori/` → `parsers/`, `classifica.py` → `standings.py`
- Rename `classifica_data()` → `standings_data()`
- Sensor IDs: `soccerlive_classifica_*` → `soccerlive_standings_*`, `soccerlive_cannonieri_*` → `soccerlive_scorers_*`
- Image filenames renamed from Italian to English
- All Italian inline comments replaced with English

## v3.0.9 (2026-06-15)
- `_process_data` returns `{"state": ..., "attributes": {...}, "events": [...]}` instead of mutating entity state in executor thread
- `self._state` and `self._attributes` now assigned on event loop only

## v3.0.8 (2026-06-15)
- Fix: manual team entry now sets `team_name` (was: created zero sensors)
- Fix: `start_date` / `end_date` from options flow now read correctly (was: only read from `entry.data`)
- Fix: cache hit path now runs `_enrich_with_summary()` and `_enrich_with_commentary()`
- Fix: translation key in team step: `team_id` → `team_name` in all 7 language files

## v3.0.7 (2026-06-15)
- Wrap data processing in `try/except`: malformed ESPN response no longer crashes sensor

## v3.0.6 (2026-06-15)
- Remove server-side geocoding (caused HA bootstrap timeout with 35+ pending tasks)

## v3.0.5 (2026-06-15)
- Non-blocking geocoding attempt (subsequently replaced by full removal in v3.0.6)

## v3.0.4 (2026-06-15)
- Server-side stadium geocoding via Nominatim (subsequently reverted due to bootstrap issues)

## v3.0.3 (2026-06-15)
